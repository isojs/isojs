As JavaScript is reaching a stage of maturity it becomes apparent that we need to define the processes that will take advantage of all the recent developments in technology that have become available to us.

The proposal is to abolish tools of the past that have become convoluted with workarounds and hacks in the process of solving problems of the past and start with a clean slate using the tools available today and aim towards the future.

Backwards compatibility should not be a concern to us, instead we should focus on doing the right thing using today's technology. Shims and tools can be used to help with the transition, but the core concepts and processes should be future-proof, meaning that eventually we shall throw away these tools and the code produced in the meantime should not require any modifications.

This is a call for discussion and everyone is encouraged to participate.
